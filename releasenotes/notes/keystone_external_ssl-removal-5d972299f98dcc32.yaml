deprecations:
  - |
    The variable ``keystone_external_ssl`` was deprecated and is no longer used.
    You still can control if communication between HAProxy and Keystone should
    be covered with TLS through ``keystone_backend_ssl`` or
    ``haproxy_ssl``/``haproxy_ssl_all_vips`` for communication between clients
    and HAProxy on frontend.

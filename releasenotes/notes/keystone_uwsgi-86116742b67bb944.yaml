    The keystone role now supports the option `keystone_use_uwsgi`, which will
    allow deployers the ability to run keystone via uWSGI without needing the
    apache webserver. When the `keystone_use_uwsgi` option is enabled, it will
    setup the uWSGI process on port 5000.

    The keystone role can now has the ability to run a minimal uWSGI process
    for keystone when the option `keystone_use_uwsgi` is set **true**. This
    feature provides operators the ability to run a minimal install without
    apache. While the minimal deployment is functional, it is not featureful.
    Things like modshib and oath are not supported when running the minimal
    setup.

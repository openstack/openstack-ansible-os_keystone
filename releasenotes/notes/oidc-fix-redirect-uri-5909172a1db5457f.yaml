upgrade:
  - |
    Keystone OIDC parameter 'oidc_redirect_uri' is replaced with
    'oidc_redirect_path'. This parameter no longer needs to be set explicitly
    unless you run additional services which may collide with the default
    on the same port as Keystone. Your OIDC provider may need to be updated
    to reflect this change in redirect URI which defaults to the Keystone
    public URL plus the path /oidc_redirect.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed OpenStack command line OIDC integration where Apache mod_auth_openidc
    if >= v2.4.9 including on Ubuntu Jammy.

    New variables have been added to manage used cache backends:

      * ``openstack_cache_backend``: defines driver, that will be used for
        caching.
        Default: oslo_cache.memcache_pool
      * ``openstack_cache_backend_map``: maps selected backend to
        the oslo driver that should be installed and configured for it.
